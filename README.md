# Popular Movies
App queries the TMDB API and fetches the top 100 most popular & highest rated movies presents them to the user in a Grid.  
When a picture is clicked a new Activity will open and will allow the user to read the fetched data of this movie(title,plot,...),trailers,reviews.  
The user will be able to read the Movie Details,watch a selected trailer via the youtube Activity,and read a bunch of reviews.  
From the App Bar user will be able to add/remove the clicked movie to/from his favorites DB, and share the movie details.  

**very important**  
app won't run unless you'll provide your own TMDB Api Key which you can get [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)  
after getting the key change the API_KEY_VALUE in NetworkUtils class and it should work.
